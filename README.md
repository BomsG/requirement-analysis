# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of my learning journey in Requirement Analysis, focused on understanding how to effectively define and structure the foundation of a software project. It includes practical exercises, notes, and templates that illustrate key concepts such as project scope, stakeholder needs, requirement elicitation, documentation, and validation. The goal is to build a solid project footprint that aligns development with real user and business needs.

ðŸ“Œ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software project should do. It involves talking to stakeholders (like clients, users, and team members) to find out what they need from the system and what problems the software should solve.

Think of it like planning a house. Before you build, you ask the owner:

How many rooms do you need?

Do you want a big kitchen?

Whatâ€™s your budget?
Thatâ€™s exactly what Requirement Analysis is â€” asking the right questions before writing any code.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important in the SDLC?
Requirement Analysis is one of the first and most important steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's why:

1.  Helps Define the Project Scope
It clearly outlines what the software will do and what it wonâ€™t do. This helps keep the project focused and avoids unnecessary work (also known as scope creep).

2.  Improves Communication
It ensures everyone is on the same page â€” developers, designers, testers, and clients. Good communication leads to better teamwork and fewer misunderstandings.

3. Saves Time and Money
By knowing what to build early on, the team can avoid rework, delays, and wasted resources. Itâ€™s much cheaper to fix a misunderstanding during planning than after the app is built.

4.  Guides Design and Development
The requirements act as a blueprint for the developers. It helps them know what features to build, what data to collect, and how the system should behave.

5. âœ” Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction
When the software meets the real needs of the users, they are more likely to be satisfied. Requirement Analysis helps ensure the product is useful, usable, and valuable.


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

Understanding user needs and turning them into clear, actionable software requirements involves several important steps. Below are the five key activities in Requirement Analysis:

Requirement Gathering

Identify and collect information from stakeholders.

Understand business goals and user needs.

Use interviews, surveys, and existing documents.

Requirement Elicitation

Explore and clarify gathered information.

Discover hidden or unstated needs.

Use techniques like workshops, brainstorming, and observations.

Requirement Documentation

Clearly write down all requirements.

Create documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) or user stories.

Provide a reference for the entire development team.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Analyze requirements for clarity, completeness, and feasibility.

Organize and structure the information logically.

Use visual models (e.g., flowcharts, UML diagrams) to represent the system.

Requirement Validation

Review requirements with stakeholders for approval.

Ensure all requirements are correct and agreed upon.

Catch issues early before development begins.
